This article explores the current applications, potential benefits, and ethical and practical challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern education. It first examines specific use cases of AI in instructional support and learning assessment; then discusses its impact on educational equity; and finally identifies key barriers to widespread adoption and suggests future directions. Research indicates that when appropriately implemented, AI can significantly enhance teaching efficiency and personalization, but its deployment must be accompanied by supportive policies and ethical guidelines to ensure fairness and integrity in education.
